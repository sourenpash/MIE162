Data Scientist (L5) - Infrastructure Experimentation,Netflix,Remote,NaN,PostedPosted 2 days ago,NaN,"Partner with other data scientists on the team, and with data scientists and engineers in the Experimentation Platform organization, to design and build…",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=1fde3b87f1d1300c&fccid=66403b30a2c0d89c&vjs=3,"Remote, United States
Data Science and Engineering
Netflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services with over 247 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

Everything that we build to delight our members, and all of the work we do to figure out how to do that better, relies on our extensive infrastructure, which spans what we rent from AWS to what we build ourselves (we operate our own custom-built content delivery network, Open Connect).

The Security, Platform and Open Connect Data Science and Engineering team partners with engineering teams across Netflix. Our goal is to use a data driven lens to enhance Netflix’s foundational technical infrastructure. We help design experiments, run analyses, productionize new data sources, and build analytic tooling that helps our partners innovate and build more performant, efficient and reliable systems.

We are seeking a Data Scientist who can help with foundational measurement problems in the infrastructure space. Our infrastructure is big and complex, and traditional approaches, such as member randomized A/B tests, are not always possible. This is an opportunity to partner with a cross-functional team to design, analyze, and build and enhance reusable tooling for our engineering partners. Experimentation techniques are critical to the long-term performance, cost management and reliability of our infrastructure, and you will be a key contributor in this area for Netflix.
In this role, you will:
Build a rapport with engineering stakeholders by thoroughly understanding their domain and supporting them in designing, executing and analyzing experiments.
Partner with other data scientists on the team, and with data scientists and engineers in the Experimentation Platform organization, to design and build scalable, self-serve experimentation tooling to meet infrastructure engineering needs.
Design and rigorously validate new A/B testing methods and quasi-experiments.
Be an advocate for the infrastructure experimentation space by thoroughly documenting your work, creating educational content, and exploring new ways to create more visibility for infrastructure experimentation across Netflix.
Execute and present strong analysis and insights, share your work proactively and consistently seek feedback to refine your approach.

You Are
Fascinated by understanding how complex systems work, but pragmatic in your solutions to experimentation problems on those systems.
An impact-oriented, applied scientist. You know the theory behind experimentation but are motivated most by how the theory is used in practice.
A great practitioner with a solid understanding of statistics.
A good coder who likes to work with python, SQL (Trino, Spark SQL), and/or PySpark
Comfortable with ambiguity and capable of navigating complex stakeholder relationships.
Able to communicate your ideas clearly and succinctly with the right amount of detail to audiences with varying technical backgrounds.
Culture
Netflix's culture is key to our success. We celebrate diversity, recognizing that diversity of thought and background builds stronger teams, and we approach inclusion equally seriously and thoughtfully. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

At Netflix, we carefully consider a wide range of compensation factors to determine your personal top of market. We rely on market indicators to determine compensation and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to get it right. These considerations can cause your compensation to vary and will also be dependent on your location.

The overall market range for this role is typically $390,000 - $900,000.

This market range is based on total compensation (vs. only base salary), which is in line with our compensation philosophy. Netflix is a unique culture and environment. Learn more here."

Norstella is a group of prominent pharmaceutical solutions providers – Evaluate, MMIT, Panalgo, The Dedham Group, Citeline – that help clients navigate complexities at each step of the drug development life cycle, from pipeline to patient. For more information, please visit Norstella.com.
Evaluate is a global company providing outstanding market intelligence services for the Pharmaceutical, Medical Device, Financial and Consulting sectors, through the Evaluate Pharma®, Evaluate Medtech®, Evaluate Omnium and Evaluate Vantage® online brands. Our international clients in Pharma and Biotech, Medtech, Banking and Consultancy regard Evaluate Pharma® as the industry’s gold standard for timely and accurate analysis of reported drug sales, consensus sales forecasts, R&D pipeline, markets and comprehensive company financials.
THE TEAM
In this role as a Data Scientist you will report into the Lead Data Scientist for Strategic Intelligence and Market Access, within the Data Science Department. You will design and deploy cutting-edge models to support the creation of new products. We have small multi-functional teams consisting of pharmaceutical industry experts, R&D, data engineering and data scientists to rapidly prototype new visualisations and interactive reports using both our existing and newly acquired datasets.

HOW YOU’LL SUCCEED
Ultimately our goal is to smooth patient access to life-saving therapies. You will work with R&D pharma specialists to understand a problem which is hindering developing and releasing effective new pharma products which we believe we can help with. After understanding the problem you will conceptualise potential solutions; in the past our solutions have involved classical machine learning, fine-tuning large language models, or simply well-designed data transformations and business logic – we’re about elegant solutions to problems rather than the technology used.
After conceiving potential solution(s), you will work with data engineering to collate data from a wide variety of sources and develop your algorithm as a proof-of-concept. You will deliver indicative results from your PoC into datasets for visualisation and exploration by the broader multi-functional team. You will also perform code reviews with the data science team to explain your approach and its strengths and weaknesses.
After iterating the design with the multi-functional team as part of customer-led product development, you might convert your prototype into a full product. This will involve productionising your code to a high standard, containerisation, and deployment of your algorithm, usually as an API in AWS SageMaker. Over time you may revisit this product, re-evaluate its performance, and retrain/improve as required.
Essential Requirements
4+ years of work related experience with Python and core data science libraries including pandas, numpy, sklearn, scipy, CatBoost, XGBoost and other similar libraries
Must have experience deploying code in cloud preferably AWS
Ability to design and iterate creative solutions in Jupyter notebooks

Salary offers are based on a wide range of factors including relevant skills, training, experience, education, and, where applicable, licensure or certifications obtained. Market and organizational factors are also considered. In addition to base salary and a competitive benefits package, successful candidates are eligible to receive a discretionary bonus.

Important Notice:
At Integra Connect, we are committed to providing a safe and secure environment for our job applicants. Unfortunately, scammers may attempt to impersonate our company to deceive individuals seeking employment. We take this matter seriously and want to ensure your job search with us is free from any fraudulent activity.
Integra Connect has become aware of recent, fraudulent recruitment activity being conducted by individuals or groups who claim to be third party recruiters and/or points of contact for our Company. Examples include sending candidates a request for personal information, conducting online interviews or meetings, making offers of employment, demanding money for employment related services and activities, or asking the applicant to purchase a laptop or other work-related equipment for the job. The aim of the fraud is to obtain personally identifying information (e.g., identity theft) and/or money. The Company’s name, as well as the names of employees, are used to try to convey authenticity.
Here are some tips to help you identify and avoid job scams:
1. Always Check the Source:
Ensure that the job listing is on our official website or a reputable job board. Our official domain is https://www.integraconnect.com/resources/careers/. Be cautious of unsolicited emails, text messages, or social media messages offering job opportunities.
2. Be Wary of Requests for Personal Information:
We will never request sensitive personal information like your Social Security number, bank details, or payment for onboarding/equipment. If you encounter such requests, it’s likely a scam.
3. Verify Contact Information:
Check that the contact information provided in the job posting, including email addresses and phone numbers, aligns with our official contact information. Scammers often use generic or non-company email addresses.
What is the sender’s email address? Is it consistent with other job postings from this company? Email addresses that are slightly different from any business’s primary contact information (“Jane.Doe@IntegraConnect.org” vs “John.Doe@Integra Connect.com”) are a common warning sign.
If you are contacted through LinkedIn, be sure to review the entire profile to verify their credentials.
If you suspect that a job offer is fraudulent, we recommend that you do not respond to it.
If you believe you are the victim of any fraudulent activity, you can report it to the appropriate authorities at https://www.myfloridalegal.com/consumer-protection/how-to-protect-yourself-job-listing-and-job-search-firms (Florida Department of State) and/or https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams#report (U.S. Federal Trade Commission).
Integra Connect is not responsible for any fraudulent offers and advises prospective candidates to follow the guidance provided above.
Thank you for your interest in a career with Integra Connect. We look forward to connecting with genuine, talented individuals like you."

About PerfectRec PerfectRec…,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=e5a11beefb5d0713&fccid=dd616958bd9ddc12&vjs=3,"Data Scientist
We are looking for an experienced Data Scientist to join our growing machine learning (ML) team at PerfectRec.
About PerfectRec
PerfectRec is a machine-learning powered decision engine focused on helping people find good, personalized recommendations without exhaustive research. Our goals are to get each person the best product for them, while saving time and money. We aim to attract billions of users, collectively save them billions and billions of hours on their product searches, and provide a similar amount of value by guiding our users to the right products for themselves at the lowest price.
We are starting with smartphones, laptops and other consumer electronics since there is an immediate and growing need for reliable recommendations for these products. We then plan to recommend other products such as cars and clothing, and then ultimately we’ll expand into other, more complicated decisions such as where to live or work. (Since you’re reading this, our non-ML based recommendation is that you really consider working here.)

Spammy search results, fake reviews, and paid affiliate sites make it nearly impossible to get an honest and relevant product recommendation. Finding the right item to meet your unique needs is tricky. Making the wrong choice based on bad information is a frustrating waste of time and money. We're solving the problem by combining actual human subject-area experts with machine learning to help everyone — regardless of their expertise — find their perfect product, quickly. To do that, we guide users through a series of questions about what they're looking for. After each answer, we share updated recommendations and encourage answering more questions to further improve our recommendations. We get more information about a user's specific needs from our quick and easy multiple-choice questions than e-commerce sites and search engines can deduce from search queries and past browsing data. Answers to our questions allow us to make better recommendations tailored to each user's unique needs.
A Small Team Where You Can Have A Big Impact
PerfectRec is a small, early-stage startup where you can have a big impact. Our founding team has experience building successful startups in the e-commerce and recommender systems space, as well as working at big organizations, like Google, Amazon, Microsoft and UC Berkeley. We are growing fast, and looking for people who are excited to build a new product where they can have a big impact. Our team is full of people passionate about the products we support, and recommending them.
Founder Led, Founder Funded
Our CEO Joe Golden bootstrapped his first startup, the custom photo products e-commerce site Collage.com, to ~$100m in revenue and a successful exit in March 2021. He’s using proceeds from that sale to build PerfectRec.
Working At PerfectRec
We are an all-remote company, so we don't care where you live as long as you work well in a fast-paced, collaborative remote environment.
PerfectRec is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We are committed to finding the best candidates for every role and giving them the tools and guidance they need to succeed. Our all-remote structure enables us to recruit anywhere in the world, so our talent pool isn't limited to a few big cities, and our asynchronous structure allows our team to work when it's best for them. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.
Learn more about how we work and our differentiating values.
What You’ll Do
On the ML team you will work on improving and expanding the core decision engine that powers the recommendations at PerfectRec. You will do this by identifying and analyzing problems as well as opportunities, exploring solutions and running experiments, and finally writing the code that puts your solution into practice and taking it live to users. Your work will directly impact and improve the user experience of anyone using the PerfectRec service and help countless users find the perfect products!
One of the areas you will work on is investigating and fixing bad predictions. When the model makes a not-so-perfect recommendation you will investigate deep into the model why this happened using analysis tools like Shapley values and others. You will identify what the likely cause is, this could be a data, feature or model issue among other things, and implement solutions that fix the problem. After running offline experiments to confirm your solution works you will roll out your improvements to production and see the recommendations improve on the live site.
Create and explore datasets for powering recommendations, working closely with domain experts.
Prototype models for making recommendations in new domains.
Use latest ML technologies such as Neural Networks, Transformers, XGBoost
Evaluate and compare different models, analyzing their tradeoffs in order to decide which model to use.
Add new capabilities that are shared between models in different categories.
Solve technical problems across the stack and contribute to all parts of our code base, including creation of our internal machine learning library.
Share your expertise and experience to grow with the team.
Collaborate with product, design, and engineers to understand customer needs, design solutions, and prototype, launch, and iterate.
Build a product that is genuinely loved by users and respects their time.
What You’ll Bring
Strong sense of ownership. Ownership is taking responsibility for the outcomes of a task or project. You’ll relish these ownership opportunities and ensure that tasks, projects, or the team are making positive forward progress.
Clear and concise communication. Building software is a team sport that relies heavily on great communication. You’ll be responsible for clear, thoughtful, and concise written and verbal communication. This includes the ability to give and receive feedback with empathy and understanding whether in a code review or a 1:1.
Willingness to learn and teach. We're always evolving with new tools and practices. You’ll be willing to jump in and learn unfamiliar technologies while also bringing others along with you. Mentorship and helping others learn are important parts of achieving this.
Creative problem solving. Creating a decision engine that can make recommendations across wide ranging domains is hard, and the potential approaches are limitless. You'll bring a research mindset and scientific rigor to evaluate and explore existing solutions, suggest new approaches, and be able to build models that successfully put them into practice.
Balance of perfection and pragmatism. Software has a lot of trade-offs and ways to solve problems. You’ll be able to recognize and balance the trade-offs between long-term system health and bringing value to customers faster. Your tooling choices will reflect ability to solve the problem the best way and not just the latest and greatest.
Requirements

No C2C or C2H will be considered for this role.
Important Notice:
At Integra Connect, we are committed to providing a safe and secure environment for our job applicants. Unfortunately, scammers may attempt to impersonate our company to deceive individuals seeking employment. We take this matter seriously and want to ensure your job search with us is free from any fraudulent activity.
Integra Connect has become aware of recent, fraudulent recruitment activity being conducted by individuals or groups who claim to be third party recruiters and/or points of contact for our Company. Examples include sending candidates a request for personal information, conducting online interviews or meetings, making offers of employment, demanding money for employment related services and activities, or asking the applicant to purchase a laptop or other work-related equipment for the job. The aim of the fraud is to obtain personally identifying information (e.g., identity theft) and/or money. The Company’s name, as well as the names of employees, are used to try to convey authenticity.
Here are some tips to help you identify and avoid job scams:
1. Always Check the Source:
Ensure that the job listing is on our official website or a reputable job board. Our official domain is https://www.integraconnect.com/resources/careers/. Be cautious of unsolicited emails, text messages, or social media messages offering job opportunities.
2. Be Wary of Requests for Personal Information:
We will never request sensitive personal information like your Social Security number, bank details, or payment for onboarding/equipment. If you encounter such requests, it's likely a scam.
3. Verify Contact Information:
Check that the contact information provided in the job posting, including email addresses and phone numbers, aligns with our official contact information. Scammers often use generic or non-company email addresses.
What is the sender’s email address? Is it consistent with other job postings from this company? Email addresses that are slightly different from any business’s primary contact information (“Jane.Doe@IntegraConnect.org” vs “John.Doe@Integra Connect.com”) are a common warning sign.
If you are contacted through LinkedIn, be sure to review the entire profile to verify their credentials.
If you suspect that a job offer is fraudulent, we recommend that you do not respond to it.
If you believe you are the victim of any fraudulent activity, you can report it to the appropriate authorities at https://www.myfloridalegal.com/consumer-protection/how-to-protect-yourself-job-listing-and-job-search-firms (Florida Department of State) and/or https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams#report (U.S. Federal Trade Commission).
Integra Connect is not responsible for any fraudulent offers and advises prospective candidates to follow the guidance provided above.
