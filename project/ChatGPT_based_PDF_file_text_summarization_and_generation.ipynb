innovation whose ideas and inspirations will guide the future success \\nof our economy. countries around the world are making large investments to unlock the benefits \\nof technological transformation for their economies and peoples. in order for canadians to reap the \\nsame benefits, we require a new approach that builds on our strong fundamentals, such as sound \\npublic finances, a low inflation environment, and the lowest unemployment rates in a generation.  \\ninnovation is the key to competitiveness, productivity, \\neconomic growth, creating good jobs, and overall making \\nlife better for all canadians. to become one of the most \\ninnovative countries in the world, canada must build a cul -\\nture of innovation, where canadians can embrace change \\nand have the right skill sets and tools to leverage emerging \\nopportunities to compete in the global economy. \\nthe multi-year innovation and skills plan is canada’s \\nresponse to this new reality, redefining the innovation  ecosystem. the plan builds on canada’s innovation \\nstrengths and addresses areas of weakness along the \\ninnovation continuum: from people and skills, through to \\nfundamental and applied research, building innovation  \\necosystems, commercializing ideas and starting-up com -\\npanies, to exporting and scaling-up globally competitive \\ncompanies across all sectors of the

building a \\nculture of innovation and a globally recognized brand for canada as one of the most innovative and \\ncompetitive countries in the world.  \\nthe plan’s integrated approach supports

continues to evolve and technological change \\naccelerates, many employers have difficulty in identifying \\nthe specific skills their employees will need as automation \\ncontinues to accelerate. \\ncanadians must possess the right skills and the flexibil -\\nity to meet the demands of the workplace in the face of \\nchanging business models. to grow and scale-up, firms \\nmust be able to fill skills gaps. they need better access \\nto global talent and to recruit from a broader pool of canadians with strong science, technology, engineering \\nand mathematics (stem), business, creative, and digital \\nskills. all canadians, particularly youth, women, and \\nindigenous people, must have more opportunities  \\nto develop key skills and upskill. they must also be  \\nconnected to high-speed

\\nproductive; they pay higher wages; they are more cyber \\nsecure; they have more diverse workforces; they export \\nmore; and they provide employees with greater job sec -\\nurity and benefits. however, only 2 percent of mid sized \\nbusinesses in canada actually succeed in growing into \\nlarge businesses.canada needs a clear path to growing more companies. \\nsmaller firms are not taking

and exporting  \\nto markets around the world. \\nthe innovation and skills plan responds by encouraging \\nthe growth of canadian businesses so they can integrate \\ninto value chains, export, and

navigate. \\nother programs were too narrowly focused for today’s \\neconomy. in addition, many canadians simply did not \\nknow where to go to get government support, preventing \\nthem from capitalizing on opportunities to grow their  \\nbusinesses and compete. \\ncanadian firms want a ‘one-stop shop’ to find government \\nprograms that meet their specific needs along the innov -\\nation continuum—whether they are looking for funding, \\ntax credits, expert advice, or wage subsidies, or forming \\nnew partnerships. it is clear that indirect support alone is \\nnot sufficient for supporting canada’s innovation system \\nacross all sectors of the economy. at the same time, pro -\\ngrams need to be responsive to firms’ needs, and  \\nall levels of government need to operate at the speed  \\nof business, and with better access and coordination.\\nto address these challenges, a whole-of-government \\nreview of business innovation programs redefined busi -\\nness innovation

existing industries and creating new \\nbusiness models. they are offering new sources of growth, \\nwhile presenting new challenges related to issues of trust \\nand privacy. these opportunities raise the risk of creating \\nnew digital divides without strong connectivity for all can -\\nadians. the insights shared by canadians in the digital and \\ndata consultations will help guide the plan going forward. \\nin addition, the government is developing new regional \\ngrowth strategies to support clean growth, inclusiveness, \\nthe scaling-up of canadian firms, and innovators in every \\npart of the country.\\nthe recommendations of six industry-driven, sector-specific \\neconomic strategy tables have already begun to be imple -\\nmented, and will inform the plan’s next steps on how to remove \\ninnovation bottlenecks and embrace new opportunities.\\nin early 2019, we are seeing positive signs emerge: in 2018 \\ncanada’s venture capital market broke records (raising \\nbetween $4.3b–$4.6b), marking a nearly two-decade high \\nin dollar flows, with a bigger proportion of late stage finan -\\ncing, signaling an upward trend in scale-up activity. canada \\nis also

technical disruption and new applications of data and digital \\ntechnologies, are driving rapid change in economies and societies around the world. seizing this \\nmoment of change, and transforming it into new opportunities and competitive advantages for \\ncanada, calls for bold and urgent action. \\nother countries recognize the importance of innovation \\nin driving long-term growth and in creating a resilient \\nworkforce for the future. they are investing heavily in \\ninnovation systems that support successful, competi -\\ntive firms. to keep up and thrive in this global innovation \\nrace, canada must build a culture of innovation. \\nwhat is innovation and why is building a culture of innovation \\nso critical to securing canada’s future? at its core, innovation  \\nis about change. it is about doing old things in new ways, \\ndoing new things in unexpected ways, solving old problems \\nwith new solutions, and utilizing technology to improve eco -\\nnomic and societal outcomes (lynch, 2010). a culture of innovation is a mindset that creatively embraces change \\nas an opportunity. it deems agility, speed, and competi -\\ntiveness as prerequisites for capturing the moment at \\nhand for inclusive economic and social benefit. it is being \\nready, willing, and determined to play a long game to \\nachieve sustainable economic and social success.\\nin 2015, it was evident that past innovation support \\nmechanisms were no longer sufficient drivers of growth. \\nfirms were experiencing skill gaps. there were too \\nmany hurdles to attract global talent. young people did \\nnot have enough access to the coding and digital skills \\nrequired for the future of work. the gender gap was \\nintroduction:  \\na time for \\nchange\\nimage credit: canadian space agency\\n\\n2\\n2\\nnot narrowing. investments in research and development \\n(r&d) were continuing to decline. relatively few compan -\\nies were scaling into globally competitive anchor firms. in \\naddition, firms found it difficult to navigate the government \\nsupport system for innovation. \\nin response, in 2017 the government launched a bold, \\nmulti-year innovation and skills plan —a major redesign \\nof the innovation policy landscape in canada. the plan \\nfeatures a brand new microeconomic framework for sup -\\nporting innovation, novel ways of thinking about how to \\ngrow canada’s economy, and experimental first-of-their-\\nkind initiatives to canada. it aims to establish a culture of \\ninnovation and a globally recognized brand for canada as \\none of the most innovative countries in the world. \\nthis approach emphasizes partnerships, collaboration, \\nand the development of innovation ecosystems. this \\nmeans greater connectivity between firms, researchers, educators, venture capitalists, incubators, all levels of \\ngovernment, non-profits, and other innovation actors. it \\nembraces canada’s diversity, and fosters the participation \\nof traditionally underrepresented groups, such as women \\nand indigenous people, in the innovation economy. \\nthe plan targets investments at all points along the \\ninnovation continuum, starting with people and skills and \\nextending to fundamental science, to commercial appli -\\ncations and new technology adoption, and to accessing \\nmarkets at home and abroad. it seeks to support firms of \\nall sizes and sectors, from manufacturing, to clean tech -\\nnology to oil and gas, to agri-food, helping them to scale, \\ngrow, and export. and, it supports canadians at every \\nstage of their working lives. from coast to coast to coast, \\ncanadians are working together to make this nation an \\ninnovation leader, a globally competitive business power -\\nhouse, and a strong and inclusive society that generates \\nbetter and more well-paying jobs today and into the future.\\n\\n3\\nto succeed and lead in the economy of the future, nations must understand, navigate, and respond \\nto powerful and pervasive global trends. past drivers of economic growth have become insuffi -\\ncient, and canada cannot solely depend on them to generate a high standard of living and quality \\nof life. disruptive technologies are rapidly changing the nature of work and the skills required for \\nthe future, transforming industries, creating new business models, and supporting the rise of new \\nworld-leading firms. \\ndisruption  \\nin a global \\ncontext \\nimage credit: north\\n\\n4\\n4\\nweakening of past drivers of growth\\nglobal economic demand \\nin canada and other developed countries, \\neconomic recovery following the 2007 \\nfinancial crisis has been slow. in contrast to \\nprevious periods, the current global growth rate of nearly \\n4 percent is not solely due to rising productivity gains or \\nsweeping structural change. instead, it is bolstered by \\nmonetary and fiscal policy support. in general, these  \\ntypes of interventions cannot sustain expansion without  \\na rise in productivity. \\nproductivity growth\\nin most countries, productivity growth—the \\nkey long-term driver of living standards—has \\nstalled, remaining well below historic averages. \\nit has slowed down among advanced economies since \\nthe early 2000s, with particular sluggishness following the \\n2007 global financial crisis. canada is no exception. annual \\nproductivity growth declined from 1.7\\xa0percent per year \\nbetween 1980 and 2000 to 1 percent between 2000 and \\n2017 (statistics canada, 2018h). \\nresource commodity prices\\nglobal commodity prices entered a period \\nof strong and sustained uptrend in the early \\n2000s due to rising global demand. by the \\npeak in mid-2008, the prices of almost all \\nclasses of commodities had risen substantially. for many, \\nthe pace of price increase accelerated between january \\n2006 and july 2008 with the price of crude oil more than \\ndoubling (devlin et al., 2011). over the next four years, \\nresource commodity prices dropped significantly, which \\nhas continued to affect canada’s oil and gas and mining \\nsectors in particular. \\ntechnological disruption\\nscientific and

not immune \\nfrom technological disruption and many are responding  \\nby introducing new methods in business practices,  \\nworkspace organization, or partnerships with other  \\norganizations (statistics canada, 2018). however,  \\ntechnology adoption remains a challenge. for example,  \\n16 percent of canadian companies surveyed by deloitte \\n(2018) use ai technologies—a number that has remained \\nstagnant over the last four years.\\nclimate change and clean growth\\nthe global focus on tackling climate change \\nand investing in clean growth and energy \\nis creating a range of economic opportun -\\nities and challenges. in december 2015, parties to the \\nunited nations framework convention on climate change \\nadopted the paris agreement to strengthen the global \\nresponse to the threat of climate change. climate change \\ncould cost canada an estimated $21 to $43 billion per  \\nyear by 2050 (national round table on the environment \\nand the economy, 2011). a growing interest in clean growth \\nand technology also presents new economic benefits,  \\nwith the global clean technology market expected to \\nexceed $2.5\\xa0trillion by 2022 (smartprosperity, 2018). in \\n2017, canada’s clean technology industry contributed \\n$28.4 billion to canada’s gross domestic product (gdp) \\nand generated $9\\xa0billion in exports (statistics canada, 2018g). \\ndemographic trends\\na combination of an aging population and  \\nlow birth rate constrains the economic growth \\nprospects of many advanced economies. \\nthe majority of the world’s population lives in nations \\nwith fertility rates below replacement and gradually aging \\npopulations, leading to declining labour force participation \\n(canada, 2017b). canadians are living longer than ever \\nand now have one of the highest life expectancies in the \\nworld. combined with falling fertility rates, these positive \\ndevelopments in longevity have resulted in canada’s over -\\nall population gradually growing older. there are now more \\nseniors aged 65 and over than there are children under the \\nage of 15, a trend that began in 2015 (canada, 2018b). the \\nwithdrawal of baby boomers from the workforce can lead to \\nslower potential output growth (cboc, 2018). globalization \\na more connected world—through trade \\nand movements in capital, people, technol -\\nogy, and data—has been associated with \\neconomic growth as well as with the halving of the global \\npoverty rate between 1990 and 2010 (the economist, \\n2013; kenny, 2017). the removal of trade barriers boosts \\nproductivity by lowering the costs of production and lifts \\nwages through increased market access and demand. \\ncanada significantly benefits from globalization, with \\nexports representing 31 percent of gdp in 2017 (statistics \\ncanada, 2018d). however, globally, the gains from trade \\nhave been unevenly spread, challenging an open and \\nrules-based system for international trade and investment \\nin some countries, making it more difficult to secure and \\nbuild on globalization’s positive aspects (oecd, 2017d, \\n2018c). new tariffs implemented by some countries are \\ndisrupting supply chains and eroding economic growth \\npotential. the bank of canada reports that trade disputes \\nand geopolitical tensions are weighing on global demand, \\nwhich is expected to reduce the level of global gdp in the \\nshort term (bank of canada, 2019).\\nthe changing dynamics of business\\nthe nature of competitive advantage and the business \\nmodels of firms are evolving. they are influenced by the \\nfuture of work; the presence of global value chains for \\nproduction and distribution; the increasing importance of \\ninnovative and competitive advanced industries; changing \\nmarkets and the rise of new digitally-led business models; \\nthe role of the consumer and the power of data as busi -\\nness disrupters; and the proliferation of clean technology \\naffecting almost every sector. to be ready to compete and \\nrespond to the new dynamics, canadian businesses must \\ncreate and seize new market opportunities, generate  \\nnew commercial value from intellectual property (ip), and \\nsuccessfully compete in the data-driven digital economy.\\nthe future of work\\njob skill requirements continue to change. on average, \\n14 percent of jobs across the oecd are estimated to be \\nat high risk of automation in the next 15 to 20 years and \\nhalf of all jobs will experience significant change (oecd, \\n2018h). the mckinsey global institute (2017) estimates that \\n\\n6\\n6\\n8 to 9 percent of labour demand in 2030 will be in jobs that \\ndo not yet exist today. not surprisingly, many employers have \\ndifficulty in identifying the specific skills their employees will \\nneed as automation continues to accelerate. \\nthe oecd (2018i) reports that digital-intensive industries \\nreward workers with relatively high levels of self-organization \\nand advanced numeracy skills. those with strong num -\\neracy skills receive an additional wage premium if they \\nalso show high levels of self-organization or management \\nand communication skills. in this context, canada has \\nthe opportunity to prepare its citizens and businesses for \\nthe future of work through building on its highly educated \\nworkforce, world-class post-secondary institutions, and  \\na strong science foundation. for example, the growing  \\nuse of new technologies in business increases demand  \\nfor digital skills and stem knowledge, and encourages \\ntheir development in workplace and formal educational \\nsettings (unesco, 2017). \\nglobal value chains (gvcs)\\nit is rare for a good or a service today to be entirely \\nproduced at one location and then exported to a final \\nconsumer. falling trade and investment barriers, the \\nrevolution in logistics technologies driven by information \\nand communications technologies, and other features of \\nglobalization have resulted in the development of complex \\nsupply chains and value webs. data-intensive supply chain \\ntechnologies such as advanced analytics, ai, robotics, and \\nblockchain are increasingly powering and shaping these \\ngvcs. joining gvcs involves demonstrating advanced \\ntechnology adoption, providing leading-edge products and \\nservices, and operating at scale to compete with the best. \\nstronger participation of canadian small and medium-\\nsized enterprises (smes) in global markets and supply \\nchains creates opportunities to scale-up, accelerate \\ninnovation, facilitate spillovers of technology and manag -\\nerial expertise, broaden and deepen skill sets, and improve \\nproductivity performance (oecd, 2017b, 2018b). canadian \\nfirms that export and participate in gvcs tend to create \\nhigher-quality jobs at home.\\nthe importance of advanced industries \\nadvanced industries anchor high-value economies and \\nrepresent opportunities for global leadership. the martin \\nprosperity institute and brookings (2018) identify 50\\xa0such \\nindustries in canada according to two criteria: (i)\\xa0r&d spending exceeds $450 per worker, above the 80th per-\\ncentile of u.s. industry intensity; and (ii) stem worker \\nshare of industry exceeds u.s. industry averages. they \\ninclude energy industries, such as oil and gas extraction \\nand electric power generation; advanced manufacturing \\nindustries, such as pharmaceuticals, motor vehicles,  \\naerospace, and machinery; and services, such as  \\nsoftware design, telecommunications, and scientific and \\ntechnical services. advanced industries account for at \\nleast 17\\xa0percent of canada’s gdp, 61

and \\nbrookings, 2018). \\nin advanced industries across all oecd economies, new \\nbusiness models that feature product customization for \\nmultiple local markets are emerging (d’aveni, 2018; öberg \\net al. , 2018). they are enabled by flexible manufacturing \\nsystems and capabilities, powered by technologies such \\nas advanced sensors, robotics, ai, and 3d printing (oecd, \\n2017f). coordinating and standardizing digital technologies \\nfor the next production revolution within advanced indus -\\ntries is proving to be complex. to successfully improve \\ncompetitiveness and grow into large global champions, \\ncanadian advanced industries must master the techno -\\nlogical complexity of the modern economy (mpi and \\nbrookings, 2018). \\nnew markets and business

vehicles, 3d printing, clean technologies, \\nadvanced robotics, and promising areas, such as ai, \\nregenerative medicine, blockchain, and quantum comput -\\ning, are reshaping the economy, our cities, our jobs, and \\nour lives. new products and markets are being created \\nand new business models are upending existing markets. \\nin today’s digital world, strategic advantages are often \\ncompeted away more quickly in all but the most innovative \\nfirms, and even new business models have shorter life \\nspans than ever before (see kiechel, 2010; atkinson,  \\n2017). disruptive technologies may also be creating  \\nmore differentiation between the largest, most successful \\nfirms and the rest of the market, fuelling a winner-takes-all \\nenvironment (frank, 2017; wilkins, 2018; calligaris  \\net al. , 2018). \\n\\n77\\nchanging markets and business models are placing a \\nnew premium on ip and, in many countries, businesses \\naggressively protect what they rightfully

success \\nof our economy. countries around the world are making large investments to unlock the benefits \\nof technological transformation for their economies and peoples. in order for canadians to reap the \\nsame benefits, we require a new approach that builds on our strong fundamentals, such as sound \\npublic finances, a low inflation environment, and the lowest unemployment rates in a generation.  \\ninnovation is the key to competitiveness, productivity, \\neconomic growth, creating good jobs, and overall making \\nlife better for all canadians. to become one of the most \\ninnovative countries in the world, canada must build a cul -\\nture of innovation, where canadians can embrace change \\nand have the right skill sets and tools to leverage emerging \\nopportunities to compete in the global economy. \\nthe multi-year innovation and skills plan is canada’s \\nresponse to this new reality, redefining the innovation  ecosystem. the plan builds on canada’s innovation \\nstrengths and addresses areas of weakness along the \\ninnovation continuum: from people and skills, through to \\nfundamental and applied research, building innovation  \\necosystems, commercializing ideas and starting-up com -\\npanies, to exporting and scaling-up globally competitive \\ncompanies across all sectors of the economy. at its very \\ncore, the innovation and skills plan builds around canada’s \\ncompetitive advantage: its people.executive  \\nsummary\\n\\niv\\na new approach to innovation policy in canada\\nthe innovation and skills plan is a major redesign of the innovation policy landscape in canada. it \\nis a new approach to drive growth and create good jobs — one that aims to succeed by building a \\nculture of innovation and a globally recognized brand for canada as one of the most innovative and \\ncompetitive countries in the world.  \\nthe plan’s integrated approach supports firms at all points along the innovation continuum and canadians at \\nevery stage of their lives. emphasizing partnerships, it brings together stakeholders from across the innovation \\nsystem. it embraces inclusivity and fosters the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in the innov -\\nation economy. it strengthens canadian leadership in key sectors by removing barriers to growth and fostering \\ninnovation in potential high-growth areas. \\ntargeting challenges and opportunities at every stage of the innovation continuum, the innovation and skills plan \\nis firmly rooted in four interconnected and mutually reinforcing pillars. \\npeople & skills\\nensuring businesses have the right pipeline \\nof talent to succeed and equipping canadians \\nwith the tools, skills, and experience they \\nneed to succeed throughout their lifetimes\\ncanada has one of the most educated populations in \\nthe world, but important skill gaps remain. as the nature \\nof work continues to evolve and technological change \\naccelerates, many employers have difficulty in identifying \\nthe specific skills their employees will need as automation \\ncontinues to accelerate. \\ncanadians must possess the right skills and the flexibil -\\nity to meet the demands of the workplace in the face of \\nchanging business models. to grow and scale-up, firms \\nmust be able to fill skills gaps. they need better access \\nto global talent and to recruit from a broader pool of canadians with strong science, technology, engineering \\nand mathematics (stem), business, creative, and digital \\nskills. all canadians, particularly youth, women, and \\nindigenous people, must have more opportunities  \\nto develop key skills and upskill. they must also be  \\nconnected to high-speed internet to participate in  \\nthe digital world. \\na new suite of programs is needed to ensure that  \\ncanadians, from all walks of life and throughout their \\nentire working years can succeed in this new real -\\nity. under the innovation and skills plan, cancode is \\ndelivering new digital skills and coding training to youth \\nand their teachers. a greater number of work-integrated \\nlearning

science has \\ndeclined over the past decade, along with business \\ninvestment in applied research and development (r&d). \\naging science infrastructure across the country has \\nalso prevented our researchers from being the best in \\nthe world. early-career and women researchers inter -\\nested in pursuing careers in science face many barriers. \\ncanada’s rate of collaboration in innovation ecosystems \\nbetween industry, academia and other innovation actors \\nlags that of other leading countries, with a low density of \\nnetworks and clusters.\\nthe government engaged leaders from the research \\ncommunity to conduct the fundamental science \\nreview. in response to the review’s findings, the gov -\\nernment has made historic investments in fundamental \\nresearch, science and infrastructure that will underpin \\ninnovation, competitiveness, and economic growth for \\nyears to come. \\nthe innovation and skills plan is also creating the  \\nright partnerships for developing new innovation \\necosystems that bridge the gaps from science, to commercialization, to investment and scale-up. to \\naccomplish this, the innovation superclusters initia -\\ntive is investing up to $950\\xa0million in five industry-led \\nsuperclusters to accelerate the growth and development \\nof large-scale business-led innovation. superclusters \\nencourage industry-driven r&d activities, pool access \\nto cutting-edge research and highly skilled talent, link \\nlarger firms with innovative smes to help them scale \\nup, \\xa0attract investment, and create hubs of global  \\ncompetitive advantage for advanced industries. \\nthe government alone cannot create a culture of  \\ninnovation; it requires partnerships with firms of all sizes, \\nboth with large anchor firms and with smaller firms that \\nare striving to grow and become globally competitive. \\nwhat’s new about this approach: \\n››takes an experimental, transformational approach \\nthat aims to build

companies and start-ups, \\nand exporting\\ndespite canada’s strong record in starting businesses, \\nrelatively few companies scale-up into globally competi -\\ntive companies, exporting and operating at the cutting \\nedge of innovation. the importance of such large firms is \\nclear: they make large investments in r&d; they are more \\nproductive; they pay higher wages; they are more cyber \\nsecure; they have more diverse workforces; they export \\nmore; and they provide employees with greater job sec -\\nurity and benefits. however, only 2 percent of mid sized \\nbusinesses in canada actually succeed in growing into \\nlarge businesses.canada needs a clear path to growing more companies. \\nsmaller firms are not taking full advantage of productivity-  \\nenhancing technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence (ai), \\nadvanced manufacturing, the internet of things, cloud \\ncomputing); attracting late-stage capital; and exporting  \\nto markets around the world. \\nthe innovation and skills plan responds by encouraging \\nthe growth of canadian businesses so they can integrate \\ninto value chains, export, and compete globally. through \\ninnovative solutions canada, a new procurement pro -\\ngram, the government is acting as a first customer for \\ninnovative small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) \\nby releasing grand challenges and inviting innovators to \\nsolve them. this approach supports the development of \\nearly-stage, pre-commercial innovations with great global \\ncommercialization potential.\\nthrough the strategic innovation fund (sif), the national \\nresearch council- industrial research assistance \\nprogram (nrc-irap), regional development agencies \\n(rdas), and business development bank of canada \\n(bdc), the plan takes a client-centric approach to work -\\ning with firms at every stage of growth. it increases the \\navailability of late-stage capital through the venture \\ncapital catalyst initiative, and patient capital through new \\nclean technology financing. canadian start-ups and smes \\nrequire this type of support to scale their businesses.\\nthe plan also helps canadian firms export and expand to \\nnew markets through increased support from the trade \\ncommissioner service (tcs) and export development \\ncanada (edc).\\nwhat’s new about this approach: \\n››provides both direct and indirect support for firms. \\n››uses the government as a first customer to support \\ninnovative smes.\\n››provides an integrated approach to support firms at  \\nall stages of growth. \\n››makes

delivery of business  \\ninnovation programs in every region\\ntraditionally, the suite of federal government programs for \\nsupporting innovation in canada was difficult to navigate. \\nother programs were too narrowly focused for today’s \\neconomy. in addition, many canadians simply did not \\nknow where to go to get government support, preventing \\nthem from capitalizing on opportunities to grow their  \\nbusinesses and compete. \\ncanadian firms want a ‘one-stop shop’ to find government \\nprograms that meet their specific needs along the innov -\\nation continuum—whether they are looking for funding, \\ntax credits, expert advice, or wage subsidies, or forming \\nnew partnerships. it is clear that indirect support alone is \\nnot sufficient for supporting canada’s innovation system \\nacross all sectors of the economy. at the same time, pro -\\ngrams need to be responsive to firms’ needs, and  \\nall levels of government need to operate at the speed  \\nof business, and with better access and coordination.\\nto address these challenges, a whole-of-government \\nreview of business innovation programs redefined busi -\\nness innovation support to make it more demand-driven \\nand targeted to real-world business needs. through \\nprogram consolidation, increased levels of direct support, \\nand a whole-of-government approach, more potential \\nhigh-growth companies are able to achieve their ambi -\\ntions for scaling-up and becoming globally competitive.the new innovation canada digital platform simplifies \\naccess to programming through a single window that \\nmatches businesses with programs and services. the new \\napproach adds value by saving companies time  \\nand money. it allows them to focus on what matters,  \\nand provides better access to financial support geared to \\ntheir individual needs and circumstances as they  \\ngrow over time. \\nto help high-growth firms reach their full potential, the \\naccelerated growth service (ags) provides support and \\nguidance in accessing key government services, such as \\nfinancing, exporting, innovation, and business advice.\\nwhat’s new about this approach: \\n››provides a single window for firms to access  \\ntailored support, with special access for clean  \\ntechnology firms.\\n››reduces the number of programs by two-thirds  \\nand increases overall funding. \\n››offers a simplified suite of programs, featuring  \\nfour flagship programs that correspond to different  \\nfirm growth stages. \\n››addresses challenges and identifies opportunities \\nthrough six business-led economic strategy tables \\nthat focus on areas of high-growth potential.\\n\\nix\\nmoving forward\\nwhile the innovation and skills plan has taken major steps \\nand made significant progress, more work must be done \\nto maintain canada’s competitiveness, strengthen regional \\necosystems, and reinforce leadership in areas of high-\\ngrowth. technology is not only accelerating changes in the \\nworkplace, but also increasing the integration and con -\\nvergence of industry sectors. new technologies, such as \\nai, are transforming existing industries and creating new \\nbusiness models. they are offering new sources of growth, \\nwhile presenting new challenges related to issues of trust \\nand privacy. these opportunities raise the risk of creating \\nnew digital divides without strong connectivity for all can -\\nadians. the insights shared by canadians in the digital and \\ndata consultations will help guide the plan going forward. \\nin addition, the government is developing new regional \\ngrowth strategies to support clean growth, inclusiveness, \\nthe scaling-up of canadian firms, and innovators in every \\npart of the country.\\nthe recommendations of six industry-driven, sector-specific \\neconomic strategy tables have already begun to be imple -\\nmented, and will inform the plan’s next steps on how to remove \\ninnovation bottlenecks and embrace new opportunities.\\nin early 2019, we are seeing positive signs emerge: in 2018 \\ncanada’s venture capital market broke records (raising \\nbetween $4.3b–$4.6b), marking a nearly two-decade high \\nin dollar flows, with a bigger proportion of late stage finan -\\ncing, signaling an upward trend in scale-up activity. canada \\nis also seeing an increasing pace of investment in young \\ntechnology companies that have the potential to become \\nsuccessful on the world stage. canada remains one of the \\ntop ranked countries in the world for talent attraction. \\nthe innovation and skills plan is a long-term plan for  \\ncanada’s future which puts people at its centre. it builds a \\nsolid foundation for success and global competitiveness. \\nwith strong business leadership, enabled by strategic gov -\\nernment support, the removal of barriers to success will \\ncontinue, investments will be made, experimentation will \\nflourish, and strong partnerships will bolster and reinforce \\ncanada’s important role on the world stage. through \\ncontinued determination and support across the innova -\\ntion continuum, canadians are embracing a new culture of \\ninnovation that champions ingenuity and embraces change \\nand disruption—propelling canada to become one of the \\nmost innovative countries in the world.

change. it is about doing old things in new ways, \\ndoing new things in unexpected ways, solving old problems \\nwith new solutions, and utilizing technology to improve eco -\\nnomic and societal outcomes (lynch, 2010). a culture of innovation is a mindset that creatively embraces change \\nas an opportunity. it deems agility, speed, and competi -\\ntiveness as prerequisites for capturing the

evident that past innovation support \\nmechanisms were no longer sufficient drivers of growth. \\nfirms were experiencing skill gaps. there were too \\nmany hurdles to attract global talent. young people did \\nnot have enough access to the coding and digital skills \\nrequired for the future of work. the gender gap was \\nintroduction:  \\na time for \\nchange\\nimage credit: canadian space agency\\n\\n2\\n2\\nnot narrowing. investments in research and development \\n(r&d) were continuing to decline. relatively few compan -\\nies were scaling into globally competitive anchor firms. in \\naddition, firms found it difficult to navigate the government \\nsupport system for innovation. \\nin response, in 2017 the government launched a bold, \\nmulti-year innovation and skills plan —a major redesign \\nof the innovation policy landscape in canada. the plan \\nfeatures a brand new microeconomic framework for sup -\\nporting innovation, novel ways of thinking about how to \\ngrow canada’s economy, and experimental first-of-their-\\nkind initiatives to canada. it aims to establish a culture of \\ninnovation and a globally recognized brand for canada as \\none of the most innovative countries in the world. \\nthis approach emphasizes partnerships, collaboration, \\nand the development of innovation ecosystems. this \\nmeans greater connectivity between firms, researchers, educators, venture capitalists, incubators, all levels of \\ngovernment, non-profits, and other innovation actors. it \\nembraces canada’s diversity, and fosters the participation \\nof traditionally underrepresented groups, such as women \\nand indigenous people, in the innovation economy. \\nthe plan targets investments at all points along the \\ninnovation continuum, starting with people and skills and \\nextending to fundamental science, to commercial appli -\\ncations and new technology adoption, and to accessing \\nmarkets at home and abroad. it seeks to support firms of \\nall sizes and sectors, from manufacturing, to clean tech -\\nnology to oil and gas, to agri-food, helping them to scale, \\ngrow, and export. and, it supports canadians at every \\nstage of their working lives. from coast to coast to coast, \\ncanadians are working together to make this nation an \\ninnovation leader, a globally competitive business power -\\nhouse, and a strong and inclusive society that generates \\nbetter and more well-paying jobs today and into the future.\\n\\n3\\nto succeed and lead in the economy of the future, nations must understand, navigate, and respond \\nto powerful and pervasive global trends. past drivers of economic growth have become insuffi -\\ncient, and canada cannot solely depend on them to generate a high standard of living and quality \\nof life. disruptive technologies are rapidly changing the nature of work and the skills required for \\nthe future, transforming industries, creating new business models, and supporting the rise of new \\nworld-leading firms. \\ndisruption  \\nin a global \\ncontext \\nimage credit: north\\n\\n4\\n4\\nweakening of past drivers of growth\\nglobal economic demand \\nin canada and other developed countries, \\neconomic recovery following the 2007 \\nfinancial crisis has been slow. in contrast to \\nprevious periods, the current global growth rate of nearly \\n4 percent is not solely due to rising productivity gains or \\nsweeping structural change. instead, it is bolstered by \\nmonetary and fiscal policy support. in general, these  \\ntypes of interventions cannot sustain expansion without  \\na rise in productivity. \\nproductivity growth\\nin most countries, productivity growth—the \\nkey long-term driver of living standards—has \\nstalled, remaining well below historic averages. \\nit has slowed down among advanced economies since \\nthe early 2000s, with particular sluggishness following the \\n2007 global financial crisis. canada is no exception. annual \\nproductivity growth declined from 1.7\\xa0percent per year \\nbetween 1980 and 2000 to 1 percent between 2000 and \\n2017 (statistics canada, 2018h). \\nresource commodity prices\\nglobal commodity prices entered a period \\nof strong and sustained uptrend in the early \\n2000s due to rising global demand. by the \\npeak in mid-2008, the prices of almost all \\nclasses of commodities had risen substantially. for many, \\nthe pace of price increase accelerated between january \\n2006 and july 2008 with the price of crude oil more than \\ndoubling (devlin et al., 2011). over the next four years, \\nresource commodity prices dropped significantly, which \\nhas continued to affect canada’s oil and gas and mining \\nsectors in particular. \\ntechnological disruption\\nscientific and

not immune \\nfrom technological disruption and many are responding  \\nby introducing new methods in business practices,  \\nworkspace organization, or partnerships with other  \\norganizations (statistics canada, 2018). however,  \\ntechnology adoption remains a challenge. for example,  \\n16 percent of canadian companies surveyed by deloitte \\n(2018) use ai technologies—a number that has remained \\nstagnant over the last four years.\\nclimate change and clean growth\\nthe global focus on tackling climate change \\nand investing in clean growth and energy \\nis creating a range of economic opportun -\\nities and challenges. in december 2015, parties to the \\nunited nations framework convention on climate change \\nadopted the paris agreement to strengthen the global \\nresponse to the threat of climate change. climate change \\ncould cost canada an estimated $21 to $43 billion per  \\nyear by 2050 (national round table on the environment \\nand the economy, 2011). a growing interest in clean growth \\nand technology also presents new economic benefits,  \\nwith the global clean technology market expected to \\nexceed $2.5\\xa0trillion by 2022 (smartprosperity, 2018). in \\n2017, canada’s clean technology industry contributed \\n$28.4 billion to canada’s gross domestic product (gdp) \\nand generated $9\\xa0billion in exports (statistics canada, 2018g). \\ndemographic trends\\na combination of an aging population and  \\nlow birth rate constrains the economic growth \\nprospects of many advanced economies. \\nthe majority of the world’s population lives in nations \\nwith fertility rates below replacement and gradually aging \\npopulations, leading to declining labour force participation \\n(canada, 2017b). canadians are living longer than ever \\nand now have one of the highest life expectancies in the \\nworld. combined with falling fertility rates, these positive \\ndevelopments in longevity have resulted in canada’s over -\\nall population gradually growing older. there are now more \\nseniors aged 65 and over than there are children under the \\nage of 15, a trend that began in 2015 (canada, 2018b). the \\nwithdrawal of baby boomers from the workforce can lead to \\nslower potential output growth (cboc, 2018). globalization \\na more connected world—through trade \\nand movements in capital, people, technol -\\nogy, and data—has been associated with \\neconomic growth as well as with the halving of the global \\npoverty rate between 1990 and 2010 (the economist, \\n2013; kenny, 2017). the removal of trade barriers boosts \\nproductivity by lowering the costs of production and lifts \\nwages through increased market access and demand. \\ncanada significantly benefits from globalization, with \\nexports representing 31 percent of gdp in 2017 (statistics \\ncanada, 2018d). however, globally, the gains from trade \\nhave been unevenly spread, challenging an open and \\nrules-based system for international trade and investment \\nin some countries, making it more difficult to secure and \\nbuild on globalization’s positive aspects (oecd, 2017d, \\n2018c). new tariffs implemented by some countries are \\ndisrupting supply chains and eroding economic growth \\npotential. the bank of canada reports that trade disputes \\nand geopolitical tensions are weighing on global demand, \\nwhich is expected to reduce the level of global gdp in the \\nshort term (bank of canada, 2019).\\nthe changing dynamics of business\\nthe nature of competitive advantage and the business \\nmodels of firms are evolving. they are influenced by the \\nfuture of work; the presence of global value chains for \\nproduction and distribution; the increasing importance of \\ninnovative and competitive advanced industries; changing \\nmarkets and the rise of new digitally-led business models; \\nthe role of the consumer and the power of data as busi -\\nness disrupters; and the proliferation of clean technology \\naffecting almost every sector. to be ready to compete and \\nrespond to the new dynamics, canadian businesses must \\ncreate and seize new market opportunities, generate  \\nnew commercial value from intellectual property (ip), and \\nsuccessfully compete in the data-driven digital economy.\\nthe future of work\\njob skill requirements continue to change. on average, \\n14 percent of jobs across the oecd are estimated to be \\nat high risk of automation in the next 15 to 20 years and \\nhalf of all jobs will experience significant change (oecd, \\n2018h). the mckinsey global institute (2017) estimates that \\n\\n6\\n6\\n8 to 9 percent of labour demand in 2030 will be in jobs that \\ndo not yet exist today. not surprisingly, many employers have \\ndifficulty in identifying the specific skills their employees will \\nneed as automation continues to accelerate. \\nthe oecd (2018i) reports that digital-intensive industries \\nreward workers with relatively high levels of self-organization \\nand advanced numeracy skills. those with strong num -\\neracy skills receive an additional wage premium if they \\nalso show high levels of self-organization or management \\nand communication skills. in this context, canada has \\nthe opportunity to prepare its citizens and businesses for \\nthe future of work through building on its highly educated \\nworkforce, world-class post-secondary institutions, and  \\na strong science foundation. for example, the growing  \\nuse of new technologies in business increases demand  \\nfor digital skills and stem knowledge, and encourages \\ntheir development in workplace and formal educational \\nsettings (unesco, 2017). \\nglobal value chains (gvcs)\\nit is rare for a good or a service today to be entirely \\nproduced at one location and then exported to a final \\nconsumer. falling trade and investment barriers, the \\nrevolution in logistics technologies driven by information \\nand communications technologies, and other features of \\nglobalization have resulted in the development of complex \\nsupply chains and value webs. data-intensive supply chain \\ntechnologies such as advanced analytics, ai, robotics, and \\nblockchain are increasingly powering and shaping these \\ngvcs. joining gvcs involves demonstrating advanced \\ntechnology adoption, providing leading-edge products and \\nservices, and operating at scale to compete with the best. \\nstronger participation of canadian small and medium-\\nsized enterprises (smes) in global markets and supply \\nchains creates opportunities to scale-up, accelerate \\ninnovation, facilitate spillovers of technology and manag -\\nerial expertise, broaden and deepen skill sets, and improve \\nproductivity performance (oecd, 2017b, 2018b). canadian \\nfirms that export and participate in gvcs tend to create \\nhigher-quality jobs at home.\\nthe importance of advanced industries \\nadvanced industries anchor high-value economies and \\nrepresent opportunities for global leadership. the martin \\nprosperity institute and brookings (2018) identify 50\\xa0such \\nindustries in canada according to two criteria: (i)\\xa0r&d spending exceeds $450 per worker, above the 80th per-\\ncentile of u.s. industry intensity; and (ii) stem worker \\nshare of industry exceeds u.s. industry averages. they \\ninclude energy industries, such as oil and gas extraction \\nand electric power generation; advanced manufacturing \\nindustries, such as pharmaceuticals, motor vehicles,  \\naerospace, and machinery; and services, such as  \\nsoftware design, telecommunications, and scientific and \\ntechnical services. advanced industries account for at \\nleast 17\\xa0percent of canada’s gdp, 61 percent of exports,  \\nand 78\\xa0percent of r&d expenditures. the annual wage  \\nof an average worker in these industries is nearly 50 per -\\ncent higher than that of other canadian workers (mpi and \\nbrookings, 2018). \\nin advanced industries across all oecd economies, new \\nbusiness models that feature product customization for \\nmultiple local markets are emerging (d’aveni, 2018; öberg \\net al. , 2018). they are enabled by flexible manufacturing \\nsystems and capabilities, powered by technologies such \\nas advanced sensors, robotics, ai, and 3d printing (oecd, \\n2017f). coordinating and standardizing digital technologies \\nfor the next production revolution within advanced indus -\\ntries is proving to be complex. to successfully improve \\ncompetitiveness and grow into large global champions, \\ncanadian advanced industries must master the techno -\\nlogical complexity of the modern economy (mpi and \\nbrookings, 2018). \\nnew markets and business models\\ntechnology is changing the way people and businesses \\naccess information, produce and buy goods and servi -\\nces, and interact with one another. the internet of things, \\nautonomous vehicles, 3d printing, clean technologies, \\nadvanced robotics, and promising areas, such as ai, \\nregenerative medicine, blockchain, and quantum comput -\\ning, are reshaping the economy, our cities, our jobs, and \\nour lives. new products and markets are being created \\nand new business models are upending existing markets. \\nin today’s digital world, strategic advantages are often \\ncompeted away more quickly in all but the most innovative \\nfirms, and even new business models have shorter life \\nspans than ever before (see kiechel, 2010; atkinson,  \\n2017). disruptive technologies may also be creating  \\nmore differentiation between the largest, most successful \\nfirms and the rest of the market, fuelling a winner-takes-all \\nenvironment (frank, 2017; wilkins, 2018; calligaris  \\net al. , 2018). \\n\\n77\\nchanging markets and business models are placing a \\nnew premium on ip and, in many countries, businesses \\naggressively protect what they rightfully own through \\nasserting their ip rights. fostering a sophisticated domes -\\ntic ip capability in canada helps businesses improve \\nthe commercialization of ideas globally and innovators \\nreach commercial success (balsillie, 2018). it also furthers \\ndiscovery and creates middle-class jobs by protecting \\ncanadian ideas and ensuring canadians reap the full \\nrewards of their inventions and creations.\\nconsumers and the power of data as  \\nbusiness\\xa0disrupters\\ndigital technologies are creating and drawing on vast \\nquantities of data. the global datasphere is estimated  \\nto grow to 163 zettabytes (zb; a trillion gigabytes) by \\n2025, or 10 times the 16.1zb of data generated in 2016 \\n(idc, 2017). these data can unlock tremendous new \\nopportunities for economic, social, and environmental \\nadvancement. this data-intensive economy, however,  \\npresents new and complex challenges, such as how to \\nensure an effective balance between supporting innovation, \\nprotecting privacy interests, and promoting trust. \\nconsumers and data are redefining the direction, shape, \\nand pace of business in many industries. consumers \\naccess large data repositories to compare market prices \\nand product availability. this is a positive development \\nfrom a competition perspective, forcing businesses to \\nbecome more agile to respond and compete successfully. \\naccording to harrington (2013), rapidly changing and often \\nunpredictable consumer buying behaviour, enabled by the \\ninternet, mobile communications, and growing spending \\npower, is making volatility and complexity the norm rather \\nthan the exception in retail. it is fragmenting sales chan -\\nnels, escalating service demands, shortening product \\nlifecycles, ratcheting up cost and margin pressures, and \\ncreating production challenges. \\ncanada has a competitive advantage as a trusted data \\nrepository. the economic importance of its reputation  \\nfor prioritizing privacy protection cannot be understated. \\nthis advantage, combined with affordable and clean energy options, has made cities such as mont'"

      "Based on the transcript, here are five steps that Canada can take to innovate:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Invest in People and Skills: Canada should focus on ensuring that businesses have access to a skilled workforce and that Canadians have the necessary skills to succeed in the changing economy. This can be done through programs that provide digital skills training, work-integrated learning opportunities, and access to global talent.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Build Innovation Ecosystems: Canada should create partnerships and collaborations between industry, academia, government, and other innovation actors to build strong innovation ecosystems. This can be achieved by investing in fundamental research, commercialization, and technology adoption. The government can also support the growth of large-scale business-led innovation through initiatives like the Innovation Superclusters.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Support Investment, Scale-up, and Growing Companies: Canada should attract investment, support the growth of leading Canadian companies and start-ups, and promote exports. This can be done by providing direct and indirect support for firms, offering simplified access to programs and services, and facilitating access to capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Simplify and Reorganize Programs: Canada should simplify access to government support programs by offering a single window for businesses to access tailored support. This can be achieved by consolidating programs, increasing funding, and providing an integrated approach to support firms at all stages of growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Develop Regional Growth Strategies: Canada should develop regional growth strategies to support clean growth, inclusiveness, and the scaling-up of Canadian firms in every part of the country. This can be done by identifying regional strengths and opportunities, removing barriers to success, and fostering innovation in specific sectors or regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "By implementing these steps, Canada can build a culture of innovation, strengthen its innovation ecosystem, and become one of the most innovative countries in the world.\n"
